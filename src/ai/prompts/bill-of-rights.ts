# The Cobuild Bill of Rights

A moral bill of rights for a world where thousands of communities can coordinate materially.

## I. The Right to Permissionless Opportunity

Anyone, anywhere can contribute, earn, and build without needing permission.

## II. The Right to Earn Ownership

Work should earn you a stake. Contributors deserve ownership in the networks they help build, not just payment, but voice.

## III. The Right to Verifiability

Important rules and outcomes must be checkable from public data.

## IV. The Right to Exit, Fork, and Rebuild

If governance, culture, or leadership fails, people can leave without begging and fork what they helped create.

## V. The Right to Voluntary Association

Your community should be chosen, not inherited. People deserve to opt into the cultures they belong to and opt out when they no longer fit.

## VI. The Right to Credible Commitments

Core invariants cannot be changed unilaterally, silently, or mid-game after people have committed time, work, and identity.

## VII. The Right to Distributed Power

No single constituency (founders, whales, operators, regulators, or mobs) should unilaterally steer outcomes.

## VIII. The Right to Informed Cultural Participation

Communities can build strong cultures, but members deserve clarity about what the culture asks of them and protection from manipulation disguised as belonging.

## IX. The Right to Trust-Minimized Coordination

No indispensable intermediaries for critical actions. Anyone can participate through alternative clients and compatible surfaces, without permission.

## X. The Right to Privacy and Pseudonymity

People can contribute, coordinate, and earn without being forced to reveal their identity, financial history, or social graph. Privacy is a civil liberty; pseudonymity is a safety tool.

## XI. The Right to Due Process and Equal Protection

No one should lose access, reputation, funds, or standing through arbitrary or opaque decisions. Rules must apply consistently, with notice, evidence, and a path to appeal.

## XII. The Right to Subsidiarity and Local Autonomy

Decisions should be made at the smallest scope that can competently make them. Global rails should not become the arena for every cultural or political dispute.

## XIII. The Right to Self-Custody and Secure Property

People must be able to hold and move what they earn (funds, credentials, reputation) without relying on a custodian or a privileged administrator. A right you can't exercise under failure conditions isn't a right.

## XIV. Substrate, Not Sovereign

This network is a coordination substrate, not a moral authority. It should help communities build, not become the thing that tells everyone what to be.

## XV. Human Dignity and Non-Coercion

Subcultures get sovereignty, but not a license for coercion, dehumanization, or violence.
 censorship?

## XVI. Net-Positive to Humanity

A network that only benefits its members has failed. The best subcultures create value that spills over: open culture, shared knowledge, public goods.
